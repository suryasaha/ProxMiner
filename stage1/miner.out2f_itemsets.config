# IN,Within, Contains, Overlap relationships will be calculated
# 10% to 30% (Ovlap-10to30)
# 30% to 70% (Ovlap-30to70)
# 70% + (Ovlap>70)

# NOTE: 
# Make sure all ranges are correct and do not overlap.
# All relation names should be UNIQUE.
# Each U or D rel should have an reciprocal relations for the opp. strand.

# 0 to 500 is computed as >=0 and <500
# U: upstream, D: downstream, O: overlap
